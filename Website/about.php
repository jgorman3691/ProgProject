  <br />
    <p>This is simply a placeholder page about me.  For right now, all it does is show some skills,<br />
      namely that I can format a page with HTML and set up an overarching CSS set.  Next is putting PHP in these <br />
      pages so that they can be dynamically changed, as well as JavaScript and, *shudder*, XML and JSON to add interactivity.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Wish me luck!
